#### Inspiration
- Recently I am interested in Natural Language Processing because I see some movie that shows the machine can understand human language

#### What it does
- analyze an essay and extract the important information out. Use d3.js to vistualize the data.

#### How we built it
- I use python to do the natural language processing part and data analysis part.
- Then I use javascript to visualize the data.

#### Challenges we ran into
- Natural Language Processing is alway a challenge. And find a better algorithm to improve the accuracy of my programs is very hard.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- I finish the project and make it funtional

#### What we learned
- How to use TextBlob and learn the basic idea about natural language processing. 

#### What's next for easy essay 
- figure out a better way to implement the project and improve the algorithm so that the project can keep evolving just like the Artificial Intelligence in Iron Man.
